# SinglePagePHP
This is a sample php project created as part of my php industrial training course at hcl cdc southex New Delhi.
It contains of two login Modes- Admin And User.
Admin can update or delete normal users from the database and view all feedback info.
The user on the other hand can only update his own information or delete his own account.
This webapp mainly uses basic html and css plus php with mysql backend.
